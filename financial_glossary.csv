307,Aggressive Growth,"Funds in this objective seek rapid growth of capital. They often invest in small or emerging growth companies and are more likely than other funds to invest in initial public offerings (IPOs) and in companies with high price/earnings and price/book ratios. Aggressive growth funds may also use such investment techniques as heavy sector concentrations, leveraging, and short-selling."
308,Alpha,"Measures risk-adjusted performance. A positive Alpha indicates stronger performance than predicted by the fund's level of risk (measured by Beta). A negative Alpha represents weaker performance than predicted by a fund's Beta. Alpha and Beta are more reliable measures when used in combination with a high R2, which indicates a high correlation between the movements in a fund's returns and the movements in its benchmark. Alpha is annualized."

314,Appreciation,An increase in the value of an investment.
317,Asset Allocation Funds,"Asset allocation funds have the ability to shift assets among asset classes (for example stocks (equities), bonds, and short-term investments).

Average annual total returns smooth out variation in performance; they are not the same as actual year-by-year results."
323,Back End Load,"A fee imposed by some funds when shares are redeemed (sold back to the fund) during the first few years of ownership.  The fee is calculated based on the value of the shares being sold.

326,Basis Point,"One-hundredth of one percent, or 0.01%. For example, 20 basis points equal 0.20%. Investment expenses, interest rates and yield differences among bonds are often expressed in basis points."
328,Benchmark,"A standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund or investment manager can be measured. Some well-known benchmarks are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index."
330,Beta,"A historical measure of a fund's sensitivity to market movements calculated by comparing a fund's monthly returns, over 36 months, to those of the fund's benchmark. By definition, the Beta of the benchmark is 1.0. A Beta of less than 1.0 indicates that the fund is less sensitive to market movements, while a Beta greater than 1.0 indicates a fund that tends to be more sensitive to market movements. For example, a beta of 1.5 for a domestic stock fund indicates that over the last three years, the fund's monthly returns have fluctuated 50 percent more than the fund's benchmark, assuming that no other factors have affected the fund's returns. Generally, the higher the correlation between the fund and the market (as measured by R2), the more meaningful a Beta is. Because Beta is based on measurements of past performance, it is not an indication of what the fund's performance will be in the future."
331,Bill (Treasury or T-Bill),A government security with a maturity of a year or less.
332,Blue Chip Stocks,"Stocks of well-established companies that have had a history of earnings and dividend payments, as well as a reputation for sound management and quality of products and services.

Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service issue ratings for different bonds, ranging from AAA (highly unlikely to default) to D (in default)."
336,Broadly Diversified International Equity Funds,"Broadly diversified international equity funds generally fall into two categories: international funds, which do not invest in U.S. securities, and global funds, which invest anywhere in the world, including the U.S. Although they are both considered more aggressive than most domestic equity funds, broadly diversified funds are often considered to be a ""less aggressive"" type of international fund because of their typical emphasis on diversification within established markets. With these funds, risk is spread out across an expansive geographic area rather than concentrated in a single region or country. These funds are used by many investors to form the foundation of the international component of their portfolio."
338,Brokerage Window,A plan feature that permits participants to purchase investments that are not included among the plan's general menu of investment options.
339,Capital Appreciation,"If the value of an investment appreciates and you sell it at a higher price than you paid, you earn a profit, also known as a capital gain. If you sell shares at a lower price than you paid for them, you'll have a capital loss."

346,Category Risk Learn More,"Morningstar assigns Category Risk Level to each group of mutual funds that invest in the same types of assets. These scores range from 1, for funds with the least amount of relative risk, to 10, for funds with the greatest amount. 


In determining the Category Risk Level, the scores based on the Morningstar Risk are reviewed by Morningstar's Research Committee. The Committee reviews the preliminary output, and makes changes where necessary, to ensure that the final scores are logically consistent and are updated to reflect current market conditions.


How Morningstar Calculates Category Risk Scores:

The first step is to determine the average Morningstar Risk for each category over the previous five years. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return (excess total return over the risk free rate, adjusted for loads) and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return (excess total return over the risk free rate, adjusted for loads and risk). Risk is measured by the variations in a fund's  monthly total returns during the period, with greater risk leading to a lower risk-adjusted return.  The Morningstar Return and Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns for each Category are found using equal weighted average of the total returns of all the funds in the category for a certain time period.  

The category's Morningstar Risk is then used as the starting point for the Category Risk Level assignments. Assignments can be modified in one of two ways. One method of modification is by logic. For instance, if one municipal bond category falls just across the dividing line from another municipal bond category, even though both invest in very similar types of assets, both categories are adjusted so that they are given the same risk assignment. They may also be adjusted by judgment. One example of this would be Long-Short Market Neutral stock funds. Although these funds tend to show very low risk scores based solely on the variations in their returns, the complexity of their strategies suggests that they should receive a higher risk score than the raw data indicates. In this case, the Category Risk score is adjusted accordingly."

Although common stocks have a history of long-term growth, their prices fluctuate based on changes in a company's financial condition and on overall market and economic conditions."
363,Communications,"Communications portfolios concentrate on telecommunications and media companies of various kinds. Most buy some combination of cable television, wireless-communications, and communications-equipment firms as well as traditional phone companies.

368,Composition by Quality,"Fidelity:
Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security held by our investment grade taxable and municipal bond funds and multi-asset class funds with a fixed income component, are categorized using the highest credit rating among the following three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO): Moody's Investors Service (Moody's); Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P); or Fitch, Inc. Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security held by our non-investment grade bond funds which include multi-asset class bond funds using a composite benchmark with more than half of its target allocation in high yield or emerging market debt, and real estate, emerging market debt and convertible security funds, are categorized using Moody's. If Moody's does not publish a rating for a security or issuer, then the S&P rating is used. When S&P and Moody's provide different ratings for the same issuer or security, the Moody's rating is used. For all funds, if none of these three NRSROs publishes a rating on the issuer or security, then the security is categorized as Not Rated. All U.S. government securities are included in the U.S. Government category. The table information is based on the combined investments of the fund and its pro rata share of any investments in other Fidelity funds.

Non-Fidelity:
Data provided by Morningstar, who surveys fund companies for the credit rating information on the funds underlying securities holdings on a periodic basis. Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO). If three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the middle rating; if two NRSROs have rated a security differently, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if only one NRSRO has rated a security, fund companies are to report that rating. Securities not rated by an NRSRO are to be included in the Not Rated category. All U.S. Government Securities are included in the AAA category. If an NRSRO provides Morningstar with a short-term issue credit rating rather than a traditional fixed income credit rating for a cash security, Morningstar will translate that short-term issue rating to an equivalent fixed income credit rating as reflected in the Credit Quality Breakdown chart. Morningstar is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund or any securities held by the fund.

For Money Market Funds:
A Tier 1 security is a money market fund eligible security whose credit rating falls in the highest short-term rating category of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations. An unrated security is Tier 1 if it represents comparable quality to a rated security as defined by SEC Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. A Tier 2 Security is a money market fund eligible security that is not a Tier 1 security."

370,Conservative,An investment approach that accepts lower rewards in return for potentially lower risks.
371,Conservative Allocation,"Conservative-allocation portfolios seek to provide both capital appreciation and income by investing in three major areas: stocks, bonds, and cash. These portfolios tend to hold smaller positions in stocks than moderate-allocation portfolios. These portfolios typically have 20% to 50% of assets in equities and 50% to 80% of assets in fixed income and cash."
372,Consumer Cyclical,Consumer cyclical portfolios seek capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of U.S. or non-U.S. companies in the consumer cyclical sector.

377,Convertibles,"Convertible-bond portfolios are designed to offer some of the capital-appreciation potential of stock portfolios while also supplying some of the safety and yield of bond portfolios. To do so, they focus on convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks. Convertible bonds allow investors to convert the bonds into shares of stock, usually at a preset price. These securities thus act a bit like stocks and a bit like bonds."
378,Convexity,A mathematical concept that measures the sensitivity of the market price of a bond to changes in interest rates.
379,Corporate Bond,"A bond issued by a corporation, rather than by a government. The credit risk for a corporate bond is based on the payment ability of the company that issued the bond. Credit risk is in addition to other risks associated with fixed-income investments such as inflation risk and interest rate risk."
380,Correlation Measures,"Measures that show the validity of a comparison between a portfolio and a benchmark, based on the historical relationship between portfolio returns and index returns."
381,Country Diversification,"Holdings are presented to illustrate examples of the countries or regions which the fund may invest, and may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.

384,Credit Quality,"Fidelity:
Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security held by our investment grade taxable and municipal bond funds and multi-asset class funds with a fixed income component, are categorized using the highest credit rating among the following three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO): Moody's Investors Service (Moody's); Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P); or Fitch, Inc. Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security held by our non-investment grade bond funds which include multi-asset class bond funds using a composite benchmark with more than half of its target allocation in high yield or emerging market debt, and real estate, emerging market debt and convertible security funds, are categorized using Moody's. If Moody's does not publish a rating for a security or issuer, then the S&P rating is used. When S&P and Moody's provide different ratings for the same issuer or security, the Moody's rating is used. For all funds, if none of these three NRSROs publishes a rating on the issuer or security, then the security is categorized as Not Rated. All U.S. government securities are included in the U.S. Government category. The table information is based on the combined investments of the fund and its pro rata share of any investments in other Fidelity funds.

Non-Fidelity:
Data provided by Morningstar, who surveys fund companies for the credit rating information on the funds underlying securities holdings on a periodic basis. Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO). If three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the middle rating; if two NRSROs have rated a security differently, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if only one NRSRO has rated a security, fund companies are to report that rating. Securities not rated by an NRSRO are to be included in the Not Rated category. All U.S. Government Securities are included in the AAA category. If an NRSRO provides Morningstar with a short-term issue credit rating rather than a traditional fixed income credit rating for a cash security, Morningstar will translate that short-term issue rating to an equivalent fixed income credit rating as reflected in the Credit Quality Breakdown chart. Morningstar is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund or any securities held by the fund.

They provide an estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit risk and interest rate sensitivity. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Portfolio holdings are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration.

Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of ""low"", ""medium"", or ""high"" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than ""BBB-""; medium are those less than ""AA-"", but greater or equal to ""BBB-""; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of ""AA-"" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates. Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve.
For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive.
For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years."

Consequently, the group's performance--and its level of volatility--tends to fall between that of the short government and long government bond categories. Morningstar calculates monthly breakpoints using the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index in determining duration assignment. Intermediate is defined as 75% to 125% of the three-year average effective duration of the MCBI."

These portfolios invest at least 70% of total assets in equities and invest at least 75% of stock assets in Latin America."
525,Leveraged Net Long,"Leveraged net long portfolios seek income by establishing long and short positions in securities.

These portfolios typically hold long positions in securities with an aggregate value of up to 130% of its net assets. In addition, these portfolios will establish short positions in securities with a market value of up to 30% of its net assets.

Because these portfolios have durations of typically more than 6.0 years, they are more sensitive to interest rates, and thus riskier, than portfolios that have shorter durations. Morningstar calculates monthly breakpoints using the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index in determining duration assignment. Long term is defined as 125% of the three-year average effective duration of the MCBI."
609,Long-Short Equity,Long-short portfolios hold sizable stakes in both long and short positions in equities and related derivatives. Some funds that fall into this category will shift their exposure to long and short positions depending on their macro outlook or the opportunities they uncover through bottom up research. Some funds may simply hedge long stock positions through exchange-traded funds or derivatives. At least 75% of the assets are in equity securities or derivatives.
610,Long-Term Bond,"Long-term bond portfolios invest primarily in corporate and other investment-grade U.S. fixed income issues and typically have durations of more than 6.0 years. Because of their long durations, these portfolios are exposed to greater interest-rate risk. Morningstar calculates monthly breakpoints using the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index in determining duration assignment. Long-term is defined as 125% of the three-year average effective duration of the MCBI."
611,Major Market Sectors,"Fidelity uses the joint classification system developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International and Standard & Poor's (MSCI/S&P) in categorizing the major market sectors. These sectors are:

Utilities, which consists of Electric Utilities, Gas Utilities, Multi-Utilities, and Water Utilities."
612,Managed Futures,"These funds primarily trade liquid global futures, options, swaps, and foreign exchange contracts, both listed and over-the-counter. A majority of these funds follow trend-following, price-momentum strategies. Other strategies included in this category are systematic mean reversion, discretionary global macro strategies, commodity index tracking, and other futures strategies. More than 60% of the fund's exposure is invested through derivative securities. These funds obtain exposure primarily through derivatives; the holdings are largely cash instruments."
613,Management Fee,A fee paid to an investment manager or advisor for its management services. A mutual fund's management fee will be included in the total annual operating expenses and disclosed in the Fee Table of the fund's prospectus.
614,Manager Tenure,Duration of the portfolio manager's employment managing a given fund or investment option.
615,Market,"An order price type placed on the execution of an order.
A market order requires that the best price in the current market at the time your order executes is used to buy or sell a security."
616,Market Capitalization or Market Cap,"The total market value of a company's outstanding securities, excluding current liabilities."
617,Market Neutral,"These funds attempt to reduce systematic risk created by factors such as exposures to sectors, market-cap ranges, investment styles, currencies, and/or countries. They try to achieve this by matching short positions within each area against long positions. These strategies are often managed as beta-neutral, dollar-neutral, or sector-neutral. A distinguishing feature of funds in this category is that they typically have low beta exposures (< 0.3 in absolute value) to market indexes such as MSCI World. In attempting to reduce systematic risk, these funds put the emphasis on issue selection, with profits dependent on their ability to sell short and buy long the correct securities."
619,Market Risk,"The risk that the price of a security will rise or fall due to changing economic, political, or market conditions, or due to a company's individual situation."
620,Maturity Distribution,"Maturity refers to the length of time until the date upon which a bond's principal must be repaid, also known as the maturity date. For fixed income mutual funds, maturity distribution shows the  relative weighting of securities of specific maturities within the portfolio."
621,Maturity or Maturity Date,"The date on which the principal amount of a loan, bond, or any other debt becomes due and is to be paid in full."
622,Mid-Cap Blend,"The typical mid-cap blend portfolio invests in U.S. stocks of various sizes and styles, giving it a middle-of-the-road profile. Most shy away from high-priced growth stocks but aren't so price conscious that they land in value territory. The U.S. mid-cap range for market capitalization typically falls between $1 billion and $8 billion and represents 20% of the total capitalization of the U.S. equity market. The blend style is assigned to portfolios where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate."
623,Mid-Cap Growth,"Some mid-cap growth portfolios invest in stocks of all sizes, thus leading to a mid-cap profile, but others focus on midsize companies. Mid-cap growth portfolios target U.S. firms that are projected to grow faster than other mid-cap stocks, therefore commanding relatively higher prices. The U.S. mid-cap range for market capitalization typically falls between $1 billion and $8 billion and represents 20% of the total capitalization of the U.S. equity market. Growth is defined based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields)."
624,Mid-cap Stocks,An investment categorization based on the market capitalization of a company.
625,Mid-Cap Value,"Some mid-cap value portfolios focus on medium-size companies while others land here because they own a mix of small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks. All look for U.S. stocks that are less expensive or growing more slowly than the market. The U.S. mid-cap range for market capitalization typically falls between $1 billion and $8 billion and represents 20% of the total capitalization of the U.S. equity market. Value is defined based on low valuations (low price ratios and high dividend yields) and slow growth (low growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow)."
626,Mid-Capitalization (Cap),A reference to either a medium sized company stock or mutual fund that invests in the stocks of medium-sized companies. A company is generally considered to be medium-sized or a mid-cap company when it has market capitalization (dollar value of outstanding shares) between $2 billion and $10 billion.
627,MIL Rate,An expression of the daily rate of per-share income earned in a bond or money market fund.
628,Minimum Guaranteed Rate,The lowest rate of return paid out by an annuity. This rate is stated in the annuity contract.
629,Miscellaneous Sector,Miscellaneous-sector portfolios invest in specific sectors that do not fit into any of Morningstar's existing sector categories and for which not enough funds exist to merit the creation of a separate category.
630,Moderate Allocation,"Moderate-allocation portfolios seek to provide both capital appreciation and income by investing in three major areas: stocks, bonds, and cash. These portfolios tend to hold larger positions in stocks than conservative-allocation portfolios. These portfolios typically have 50% to 70% of assets in equities and the remainder in fixed income and cash."
631,Money Manager allocation,"The Strategic Advisers Multi-Manager Funds can engage both Fidelity and non-Fidelity managers as subadvisers, as well as invest in Fidelity funds, third-party mutual funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs).  Subadvisers are professional money managers selected by SAI to manage a portion of the mutual fund's assets consistent with a specific investment mandate or area of expertise. The sub advisers make the day-to-day investment decisions for the portion of the fund they manage."
632,Money Market Fund,"A mutual fund that primarily invests in short-term, high-grade fixed-income securities, such as Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit, and commercial paper, and seeks the highest level of income consistent with preservation of capital (i.e., maintaining a stable share price). You could lose money by investing in a money market fund.  Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.  An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.  Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time."
633,Morningstar Category,"In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category classifies funds based on their investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years). If the fund is new and has no portfolio, Morningstar estimates where it will fall before assigning a more permanent category. When necessary, Morningstar may change a category assignment based on current information."
634,Morningstar Category Average,"Morningstar Category classifies funds based on their investment styles as measured by their  holdings.  Measurements such as returns, risk, and expenses are grouped by category, with the mean for each measurement serving as the average."
635,Morningstar Overall Ratings,"The overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating (based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.
Morningstar distributes the stars accordingly:
"" The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars
"" the next 22.5% receive 4 stars
"" the next 35% receive 3 stars
"" the next 22.5% receive 2 stars
"" the bottom 10% receive 1 star
Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages."
636,Morningstar Return,"The Morningstar Return figure rates a fund's performance relative to other funds in its investment category. After adjusting for maximum front-end loads, applicable back-end loads, and applicable redemption fees, Morningstar calculates the excess return for each fund, defined as the fund's load-adjusted return minus the return for 90-day T-Bills over the same period. The use of excess instead of raw returns reflects our belief that mutual funds should be rated highly for only those returns earned beyond those of a T-Bill, which is essentially a risk-free investment. The excess returns are then compared with the higher of the average excess return of the fund's broad investment category or the 90-day T-Bill return. This last adjustment prevents distortions caused by having low or negative average excess returns in the equation's denominator, as might occur during a protracted down market. The return and risk assessments are based on a fund's historical performance relative to other funds in one of four broad investment categories (domestic equity, international equity, taxable bond, or municipal bond). It's important to realize that information is historical and purely quantitative. The assessments do not reflect Morningstar's opinion of the future potential of the fund; they only give a quick summary of how a fund has performed historically relative to its peers."
637,Morningstar Risk,"The Morningstar Risk statistic evaluates the fund's downside volatility relative to that of other funds in its broad investment category. Morningstar uses a proprietary risk measure that operates differently from traditional risk measures, such as beta and standard deviation, which see both greater- and less than-expected returns as added volatility. Morningstar believes that most investors' greatest fear is losing money, defined as underperforming the risk-free rate of return an investor can earn from the 90-day Treasury bill, so its risk measure focuses only on that downside risk. To calculate the risk score, Morningstar plots monthly fund returns in relation to T-Bill returns. The amounts by which the fund trails the T-Bill return is added each month and that total is divided by the period's total number of months. This number, the average monthly underperformance statistic, is then compared with those of other funds in the same broad investment category to assign a risk score. The resulting risk score expresses how risky the fund is relative to the average fund in its category. Note that Morningstar does not rate any fund that has less than three years of performance data."
638,"Morningstar, Inc.",A leading mutual fund research and tracking firm.
639,Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS),"Securities backed by mortgages. Such certificates are issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Federal National Mortgage Association. Others are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association. Investors receive payments out of the interest and principle on the underlying mortgages. Sometimes banks issue certificates backed by conventional mortgages, selling them to large institutional investors. The growth of mortgage-backed certificates and the secondary mortgage market in which they are traded has helped keep mortgage money available for home financing."
640,Moving Averages,An indicator frequently used in technical analysis showing the average value of a security's price over a set period. Moving averages are generally used to measure momentum and define areas of possible support and resistance.
641,Multialternative,These funds offer investors exposure to several different alternative investment tactics. Funds in this category have a majority of their assets exposed to alternative strategies. An investor's exposure to different tactics may change slightly over time in response to market movements. Funds in this category include both funds with static allocations to alternative strategies and funds tactically allocating among alternative strategies and asset classes. The gross short exposure is greater than 20%.
642,Multisector Bond,"Multisector-bond portfolios seek income by diversifying their assets among several fixed income sectors, usually U.S. government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds, foreign bonds, and high-yield U.S. debt securities. These portfolios typically hold 35% to 65% of bond assets in securities that are not rated or are rated by a major agency such as Standard & Poor's or Moody's at the level of BB (considered speculative for taxable bonds) and below."

Note
A debt obligation similar to a bond, but with a maturity date less than five years from date of issue."
672,Nontraditional Bond,"The Nontraditional Bond category contains funds that pursue strategies divergent in one or more ways from conventional practice in the broader bond-fund universe. Many funds in this group describe themselves as ""absolute return"" portfolios, which seek to avoid losses and produce returns uncorrelated with the overall bond market; they employ a variety of methods to achieve those aims. Another large subset are self-described ""unconstrained"" portfolios that have more flexibility to invest tactically across a wide swath of individual sectors, including high-yield and foreign debt, and typically with very large allocations. Funds in the latter group typically have broad freedom to manage interest-rate sensitivity, but attempt to tactically manage those exposures in order to minimize volatility. The category is also home to a subset of portfolios that attempt to minimize volatility by maintaining short or ultra-short duration portfolios, but explicitly court significant credit and foreign bond market risk in order to generate high returns. Funds within this category often will use credit default swaps and other fixed income derivatives to a significant level within their portfolios."
673,Note,"A debt obligation similar to a bond, but with a maturity date less than five years from date of issue."
674,Offer Price,"The lowest price that a seller is willing to accept from a prospective buyer. In the case of a mutual fund with a sales charge, this price is the net asset value (NAV) plus the sales charge. In the case of no-load funds, it is the NAV."

If rates rise 1.00%, for example, a fund with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value. Other factors also can influence a bond fund's performance and share price. A bond fund's actual performance may differ.

For the fixed income investments, duration estimates how much a bond fund's price will change with a change in comparable interest rates  Weighted average maturity is a weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes and markets changes. For money market funds, weighted average life is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity."

697,Quarter-End Average Annual Total Returns,"Quarter-end Average annual total return is a rate of return on a quarterly basis that, if achieved annually, would have produced the same cumulative total return if performance had been constant over the entire period. Average annual total returns smooth out variation in performance; they are not the same as actual year-by-year results."
698,R2,"A measurement of how closely the portfolio's performance correlates with the performance of a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. R2 is a proportion which ranges between 0.00 and 1.00. An R2 of 1.00 indicates perfect correlation to the benchmark index, that is, all of the portfolio's fluctuations are explained by performance fluctuations of the index, while an R2 of 0.00 indicates no correlation. Therefore, the lower the R2, the more the fund's performance is affected by factors other than the market as measured by that benchmark index."
699,Rate Information,"Displays payment data for an annuity, including the current and guaranteed payment rate and the period of time that the issuing company agrees to make payments."

710,Reinvestment Price,"The price at which additional shares of a fund are purchased using the proceeds of money distributed by that fund, usually in the form of capital gains or dividends."
711,Relative Volatility,A ratio of a portfolio's standard deviation to the standard deviation of a benchmark index.
712,Retirement Income,"Retirement income portfolios provide a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash for those investors already in or entering retirement. These portfolios tend to be managed to more of a conservative asset-allocation strategy. These portfolios aim to provide investors with steady income throughout retirement."
713,Return,"The gain or loss on an investment. A positive return indicates a gain, and a negative return indicates a loss."
714,Return Before Taxes,"Return before taxes is a measure of a fund's performance over a given time frame before accounting for the effect of taxes. Dividends generated by, and distributions made on, an investment, as well as gain or losses recognized upon sale of an investment, may be taxable. Taxes may reduce the value of the dividend, distribution or sale proceeds in the hands of the investor. As each investor's tax situation may differ, return before taxes provide a valuable benchmark against which an investor can easily compare the return before taxes of other investments without regard to tax consequences. Unless otherwise noted, returns are adjusted for all applicable recurring and non-recurring fees (including redemption fees), loads and charges, if any."
715,Risk of this Category,"The Morningstar Risk statistic evaluates the fund's downside volatility relative to that of other funds in its broad investment category. Morningstar uses a proprietary risk measure that operates differently from traditional risk measures, such as beta and standard deviation, which see both greater- and less than-expected returns as added volatility. Morningstar believes that most investors' greatest fear is losing money, defined as underperforming the risk-free rate of return an investor can earn from the 90-day Treasury bill, so its risk measure focuses only on that downside risk. To calculate the risk score, Morningstar plots monthly fund returns in relation to T-Bill returns. The amounts by which the fund trails the T-Bill return is added each month and that total is divided by the period's total number of months. This number, the average monthly underperformance statistic, is then compared with those of other funds in the same broad investment category to assign a risk score. The resulting risk score expresses how risky the fund is relative to the average fund in its category. Note that Morningstar does not rate any fund that has less than three years of performance data."
717,Sales Charge,A charge for buying an investment.
718,Sales Load,A fee charged when you purchase shares in a mutual fund. It calculated as a percentage of the fund's offering price.

722,Sector Diversification,This data represents the industries in which a fund invests.
723,Sector Funds,"Sector funds invest in the stocks of one specific sector of the economy, such as health care, chemicals, or retailing. These funds tend to be more volatile than funds holding a diversified portfolio of stocks in many industries."
726,Self-Directed Brokerage Account,"An account in which a plan participant makes individual decisions about what stocks, bonds and mutual funds to buy through a brokerage window."
727,Separate Account,An insurance company account that is segregated or separate from the insurance company's general assets. Also refers to an investment option managed by an investment adviser for a single plan.
729,Share Class,"Some mutual funds and companies offer more than one type or group of shares, each of which is considered a class (e.g., ""Class A,"" ""Advisor"" or ""Institutional"" shares). For mutual funds each class has different fees and expenses but all the classes invest in the same pool of securities and have the same investment objectives. A mutual fund's prospectus provides details regarding fees and expenses."
730,Share Price,"The value of one share of either a stock or mutual fund. The share prices of stocks are recalculated throughout the trading today. With most mutual funds, the share price is calculated at the end of each trading day in response to  movements of the securities in which the fund invests."
731,Shareholder,The owner of one or more shares of stock in a corporation or one or more shares or units of a mutual fund.
732,Shareholder-Fees,"Any fee charged against your investment for purchase and sale, other than the total annual operating expenses."
733,Sharpe Ratio (3-Year),"The Sharpe ratio is a measure of historical adjusted performance calculated by dividing the fund's excess returns (fund's average monthly returns minus the average monthly return of the Salomon Smith Barney 3-Month T-Bill Index) by the standard deviation of those returns. The higher the ratio, the better the fund's return per unit of risk."
734,Short Government,"Short-government portfolios have at least 90% of their bond holdings in bonds backed by the U.S. government or by government-linked agencies. This backing minimizes the credit risk of these portfolios, as the U.S. government is unlikely to default on its debt. These portfolios have durations typically between 1.0 and 3.5 years, so they have relatively less sensitivity to interest rates and, thus, low risk potential. Morningstar calculates monthly breakpoints using the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index in determining duration assignment. Short is defined as 25% to 75% of the three-year average effective duration of the MCBI."
735,Short-Term Bond,"Short-term bond portfolios invest primarily in corporate and other investment-grade U.S. fixed income issues and typically have durations of 1.0 to 3.5 years. These portfolios are attractive to fairly conservative investors, because they are less sensitive to interest rates than portfolios with longer durations. Morningstar calculates monthly breakpoints using the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index in determining duration assignment. Short-term is defined as 25% to 75% of the three-year average effective duration of the MCBI."
736,Short-Term Redemption Fee,"This fee is charged when money is withdrawn from a fund within a specified time period deemed ""short-term,"" by the fund, commonly 30, 180, or 365 days. Please refer to the fund's prospectus for further details."
737,Short-Term Redemption Fee Period,"The length of time a Short Term Redemption Fee is in effect, commonly 30, 180, or 365 days."
738,Small Blend,Small-blend portfolios favor U.S. firms at the smaller end of the market-capitalization range. Some aim to own an array of value and growth stocks while others employ a discipline that leads to holdings with valuations and growth rates close to the small-cap averages. Stocks in the bottom 10% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as small cap. The blend style is assigned to portfolios where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate.
739,Small Capitalization (Cap),A reference to either a small company stock or mutual fund that invests in the stocks of small companies. A company is generally considered small when it has a total value or market capitalization (dollar value of outstanding shares) of less than $2 billion.
740,Small Growth,"Small-growth portfolios focus on faster-growing companies whose shares are at the lower end of the market-capitalization range. These portfolios tend to favor companies in up-and-coming industries or young firms in their early growth stages. Because these businesses are fast growing and often richly valued, their stocks tend to be volatile. Stocks in the bottom 10% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as small cap. Growth is defined based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields)."
741,Small Value,"Small-value portfolios invest in small U.S. companies with valuations and growth rates below other small-cap peers. Stocks in the bottom 10% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as small cap. Value is defined based on low valuations (low price ratios and high dividend yields) and slow growth (low growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow)."
742,Small-Cap Funds,"The securities of smaller, less-known companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies."
743,Small-cap Stocks,An investment categorization based on the market capitalization of a company.
744,Source,"A source is the origin of your money in your retirement plan. Examples of sources include: employee contribution (the money you contribute), company match (the money your employer may contribute), and rollover money (the money that you may have rolled over into this plan from a prior employer's qualified retirement plan or an IRA)."
745,Stable Value,"Stable-value portfolios seek to provide income while preventing price fluctuations. The most common stable-value portfolios invest in a diversified portfolio of bonds and enter into wrapper agreements with financial companies to guarantee against fluctuations in their share prices. These wrapper agreements typically provide price stability on a day-to-day basis, thereby insulating each portfolio's net asset value from interest-rate volatility. Therefore, the duration for each of these funds is essentially zero. This category is only used in Morningstar's custom fund and separate account databases."
746,Stable Value Fund,A type of investment option that is designed to preserve principal while providing a consistent rate of return. Stable value funds invest primarily in fixed-income securities.
747,Standard Deviation,"Statistical measure of how much a return varies over an extended period of time. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider dispersion of past returns and thus greater historical volatility. Standard deviation does not indicate how an investment actually performed, but it does indicate the volatility of its returns over time."
749,Stock Commissions,"Shows the trading costs incurred by funds, with the breakdown showing how different share quantities result in different commission rates."
750,Stock Fund,A fund that invests primarily in stocks.
752,Style,"Equity or stock funds are generally divided into three categories: Growth, Value, or Blend, which represents a combination of the two. The term growth is based on fast growth (high growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) and high valuations (high price ratios and low dividend yields). The term value is based on low valuations (low price ratios and high dividend yields) and slow growth (low growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) that are expected to increase over time."
753,Style Spectrum,"While ""Style Spectrum"" is not a term of art, it refers generally to the range of ""growth vs. value"" comparisons that many investors and advisory institutions use in understanding a mutual fund's investment style. To say that a fund is invested ""across the style spectrum"" indicates that it holds notable commitments to growth stocks, value stocks, and partial growth/value stocks."
754,StyleMap,"StyleMap®depictions of mutual fund characteristics produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past three years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed."

771,Targeted International Equity Funds,"Mutual funds that invest in stocks issued by companies located in specific countries or regions around the world. These funds can be divided into two general subcategories: 
Country/region funds generally invest in companies located in a specific country or geographical area, such as Germany or Asia-Pacific. 
Emerging market funds focus on the world's developing countries, where rapid industrialization may offer high potential gains, but may also lead to extreme volatility."
772,Taxable Money Market,These portfolios invest in short-term money market securities in order to provide a level of current income that is consistent with the preservation of capital.
773,Tax-deferred Annuity,"An insurance contract, issued by an insurance company, that allows you to accumulate savings on a tax-deferred basis for long-term goals, such as retirement. There are fixed and variable tax-deferred annuities.
With a fixed-deferred annuity, your savings earn a set rate of return, which is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specific period of time. You choose an interest rate for a period of time, usually ranging from 1 to 10 years. 
With a variable-deferred annuity, you choose how to allocate the assets in your annuity among a number of managed portfolios, with options ranging from very conservative to very aggressive. You will have the flexibility to change your portfolio's allocations as your situation or market conditions change. Once you're retired and need income, you can turn the money accumulated in your annuity into a regular stream of income, or take partial withdrawals as the need arises."

789,Trading Symbol,See Ticker Symbol.
790,Trading-Inverse Commodities,"These funds seek to generate returns equal to an inverse multiple of short-term returns of a commodity index. The compounding of short-term returns results in performance that does not correspond to those of investing in the index with external leverage. For example, a fund attempting to achieve negative 2 times the returns of a given index on a daily basis is unlikely to deliver anything like negative 2 times the index's returns over periods longer than one day. Many of these funds seek to generate a multiple typically negative 1 to negative 3 times of the daily or weekly return of the reference index. Trading funds are not considered suitable for a long-term investor and are designed to be used by active traders."
791,Trading-Inverse Debt,"These funds seek to generate returns equal to an inverse fixed multiple of short-term returns of a fixed-income index. The compounding of short-term returns results in performance that does not correspond to those of investing in the index with external leverage. For example, a fund attempting to achieve negative 2 times the returns of a given index on a daily basis is unlikely to deliver anything like negative 2 times the index's returns over periods longer than one day.

Trading funds are not considered suitable for a long-term investor and are designed to be used by active traders."
796,Trading-Miscellaneous,"These funds seek to generate returns equal to a fixed multiple (positive or negative) of short-term returns of an index. The reference index for this category is not equity, fixed-income, or commodity linked. The compounding of short-term returns results in performance that does not correspond to those of investing in the index with external leverage. For example, a fund attempting to achieve 2 times the returns of a given index on a daily basis is unlikely to deliver anything like 2 times the index's returns over periods longer than one day. Many of these funds seek to generate a multiple of the daily or weekly return of the reference index. Trading funds are not considered suitable for a long-term investor and are designed to be used by active traders."
797,Trustee,"A person or entity (e.g., bank, trust company, or other organization) that is responsible for the safekeeping of trust assets."
798,Turnover Rate,See Portfolio Turnover Rate.
799,U.S. Treasury Securities,"Debt securities issued by the U.S. government and secured by its full faith and credit for the prompt payment of principal and interest at maturity. Treasury securities are the debt financing instruments of the United States Federal government, and they are often referred to simply as Treasuries."
800,U.S. Treasury STRIPS,Zero-coupon bonds which pay principal and interest on maturity. Each fund compares its performance to the average of the total returns of two U.S. Treasury STRIPS (evenly weighted by par amount) that mature close to the fund's target maturity dates (August 15 and November 15 of the appropriate year).
801,Ultrashort Bond,"Ultrashort-bond portfolios invest primarily in investment-grade U.S. fixed-income issues and have durations typically of less than one year. This category can include corporate or government ultrashort bond portfolios, but it excludes international, convertible, multisector, and high-yield bond portfolios. Because of their focus on bonds with very short durations, these portfolios offer minimal interest-rate sensitivity and therefore low risk and total return potential. Morningstar calculates monthly breakpoints using the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index in determining duration assignment. Ultrashort is defined as 25% of the three year average effective duration of the MCBI."
802,Unit,A representation of ownership in an investment that does not issue shares.
803,US Dollar,"The US Dollar Index is an average of six major world exchange rates providing a general indication of the international value of the US dollar. The Intercontinental Exchange determines the value of the US Dollar Index by averaging the exchange rates between the USD and the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. The US Dollar Index is computed using a trade-weighted geometric average of six currencies."
804,Utilities,"Utilities portfolios seek capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of U.S. or non-U.S. public utilities including electric, gas, and telephone-service providers."
805,Value,"A style of equity investing. A fund is said to be a value fund if it holds securities that have low valuations (low price ratios and high dividend yields) and slow growth (low growth rates for earnings, sales, book value, and cash flow) that are expected to increase over time."
806,Value Date,The date on which a foreign exchange transaction or a cash movement takes place. Can be used interchangeably with settlement date.
807,Value Fund,A fund that invests primarily in stocks that are believed to be priced below what they are really worth.
808,Value Stocks,"Stocks that are considered to be undervalued based upon such ratios as price-to-book or price-to-earnings (P/E). These stocks generally have lower price-to-book and price-earnings ratios, higher dividend yields and lower forecasted growth rates than growth stocks."
809,Variable Annuity,An annuity where the customer has a choice where his contract value will be invested and which provides (with the exception of any minimum payment which may be guaranteed by an insurance company) that the customer bears the investment risks and receives the actual investment performance less certain charges.
810,Variable Return Investment,Investments for which the return is not fixed. This term includes stock and bond funds and also investments that seek to preserve principal like money market funds and stable value funds but do not guarantee a particular return.
812,Volatility Measures,"Volatility measures are based on the variability of historical returns of the portfolio. In the case of annuity funds, this is before the effect of annuity charges. Relative Volatility, Beta, and R2 compare a portfolio's total return to those of a relevant market, represented by the benchmark index. Standard Deviation is calculated independent of an index."
813,Weighted Average Life (WAL),"For money market funds, this is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. WAL is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid, taking into account any call options exercised by the issuer and any permissible maturity shortening features other than interest rate resets. For money market funds, the difference between WAM and WAL is that WAM takes into account interest rate resets and WAL does not. WAL for money market funds is not the same as WAL of a mortgage- or asset-backed security."
814,Weighted Average Maturity (WAM),"This is a weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes and markets changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity to such changes. WAM is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid. Depending on the types of securities held in a fund, certain maturity shortening devices (e.g., demand features, interest rate resets, and call options) may be taken into account when calculating the WAM."
815,Withholding Tax,"A tax assessed by the relevant tax authority on distributions, including dividends and capital gains. Tax rates of withholding amounts vary by transaction."
816,World Allocation,"World-allocation portfolios seek to provide both capital appreciation and income by investing in three major areas: stocks, bonds, and cash. While these portfolios do explore the whole world, most of them focus on the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the larger markets in Europe. It is rare for such portfolios to invest more than 10% of their assets in emerging markets. These portfolios typically have at least 10% of assets in bonds, less than 70% of assets in stocks, and at least 40% of assets in non-U.S. stocks or bonds."
817,World Bond,"World-bond portfolios invest 40% or more of their assets in foreign bonds. Some world-bond portfolios follow a conservative approach, favoring high-quality bonds from developed markets. Others are more adventurous and own some lower-quality bonds from developed or emerging markets. Some portfolios invest exclusively outside the U.S., while others regularly invest in both U.S. and non-U.S. bonds."
818,World Stock,"World-stock portfolios have few geographical limitations.
